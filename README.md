This project implements a Cache Simulator supporting Least Recently Used (LRU) and First In First Out (FIFO) replacement policies.
The simulator tracks cache hits, misses, and evictions while processing a sequence of memory access requests.

The goal is to demonstrate how different cache replacement strategies behave under identical access patterns using efficient data structures.
